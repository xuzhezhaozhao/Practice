Yahoo! Hack Beijing Challenge----Question 1

Given a rational number expressed as A/B where A and B are integers, find the position of Mth occurrence of digit D (0-9) after decimal point. For example 3/7 = 0.4285714285... (A=3, B=7), so the 2nd (M=2) 4 (D=4) is the 7th digit after decimal point.
Limits:
0 < A, B, M < 2 x 108
0 <= D <= 9
Input:
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, N. N test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing 4 numbers, A, B, M and D separated by spaces.
Output:
Each line contains the position (starting from 1) of the specified digit D. Output â0â if it is impossible to find the digit.
Sample:
Input:

3 7 2 2
3 7 3 6
5 11 2 3
5 11 3 7
